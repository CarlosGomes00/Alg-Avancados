## Package

This project aims to create a package with various modules covering different topics in Analysis of Algorithms in Biology (AAB). Each topic will be addressed in a separate module, providing clear organization and facilitating code development and maintenance.

### Modules

1. **Motifs**
   - Implementation of the Gibbs Sampling algorithm for identifying motifs in biological sequences.

2. **Evolutionary Computation**
   - Development of evolutionary computation algorithms to solve problems related to computational biology.

3. **Pattern Matching**
   - Implementations of pattern matching algorithms, including Finite Automata, Tries, and Suffix Trees.

4. **Alignments Against References (BWTs)**
   - Module dedicated to performing alignments of biological sequences using the Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT).

5. **Graphs**
   - Functionality for manipulation and analysis of graphs in biological contexts.

6. **Biological Networks**
   - Implementations for analysis and manipulation of biological networks, including network analysis algorithms and visualization methods.

7. **Genome Assembly**
   - Module focused on the process of genome assembly, covering relevant techniques and algorithms for this process.
